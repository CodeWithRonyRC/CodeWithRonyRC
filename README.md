# About me
I am a Java programmer currently taking courses in Spring Frameworks, microservices architecture, Hibernate/JPA, Kubernetes/Docker, concurrency and multithreading, as well as APIs and web services.

I am a persistent individual when it comes to achieving my goals, friendly, and always interested in participating in projects that can make a meaningful difference.
